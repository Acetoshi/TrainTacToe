# TrainTacToe
An app where you can train your AI to play tic tac toe. Can it beat you ? 

This project aims at making a web page that can help you understand what reinforced machine learning is. 
You play Tic Tac Toe against the computer and can see the live database that it uses to make its move against you.

It was inspired by a video of Matt Parker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9c-_neaxeU , that showed the projet M.E.N.A.C.E https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/menace/ in a video with Matthew Srcoggs.

The whole thing is based on the works of Donald Michie in 1960.
